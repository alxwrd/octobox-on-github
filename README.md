# ![](/src/icons/icon.png) Octobox on GitHub

_This software has been archived because I have no need to work on it with the new
[GitHub notifications](https://github.blog/2019-11-13-universe-day-one/#notifications)_

Octobox is a fantastic alternative to GitHub notifications. However, one issue
is if you read the notification on GitHub, it won't be imported to Octobox.

This extention aims to solve that by replacing the default bell icon with the
Octobox logo. On click, it will open https://octobox.io/ in a new tab.
